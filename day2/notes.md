When a problem is encountered between two numbers, one of them as to be removed. 

--> wrong:

4 5 4 3 2 1

i=0, no problems
i=1, if distance is too great, remove i=0 or i=1.
up or down is defined
i=2, if dist is too great, try remove i=1 or i=2
if we're going wrong way, can try to remove i=0 as well.
